# Changelog (OpenIMP)

**Where to read what**

- **This file**: release-oriented summary per area (what changed against the vendor stack and against the original upstream line, [opensensor/openimp](https://github.com/opensensor/openimp)), followed by the condensed OpenIMP-only log by date.
- **Full campaign log**: [docs/OPEN_STACK_CHANGELOG.md](docs/OPEN_STACK_CHANGELOG.md): every change of OpenIMP, open-tx-isp, timps and the thingino integration since 2026-09-30, per session, with device-test evidence and numbers. The same text is on the wiki page *Changelog*.
- **Current state per feature and SoC**: [docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md](docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md) (HTML view: [docs/feature-matrix.html](docs/feature-matrix.html)); what goes beyond the vendor: [docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md](docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md).

Release plan: `next` goes to `aperto` (fast-forward only) after the long soak of the release candidate and is tagged `vYYYY.MM.DD`; until then dates are the reference. The first release covers T10, T20, T21, T23 and T31; T10 has not been re-tested on the open stack today ("not re-tested"); T41 is not part of the first release. Branch names (`claude/...`) are historic: the topic branches were merged into `next` and deleted. Cameras are anonymised: cam-A (T31), cam-B (T23), cam-C (T20), cam-D (T21), cam-E (T10), cam-F (T41); cam-G and cam-H are further T23 cameras, cam-I a second T20, cam-J a second T21.

## Release candidate agg-34 (state of 2026-10-09 evening)

OpenIMP `agg-34` (838f8147) = agg-32 (8980cae) + encoder ROI clamp (fec3e69, 8545fb9) + reviewed DeepSeek patches (11abe42 and 17 patches); open-tx-isp `agg-34` (da9baf1e) = agg-32 (3cf9bdac) + front-crop fixes for T31, T23, T20 and T10 (d940ba20 to 10bac52f, 164225e5) + T20 `isp-m0` gain cap (da9baf1e). The first release still covers T10, T20, T21, T23 and T31; T41 is experimental and not part of it. The combination agg-34 has not run on the cameras as a whole; the individual fixes below were device-tested on the SoC named.

- **agg-32 soak (2026-10-07 16:07 to 2026-10-09 11:31, 43.4 h):** 0 unplanned reboots, 0 oopses, 0 guard trips, 0 snapshot failures and no memory trend on the seven timps cameras without user interaction; the only reboots were a planned OTA and two crashes from a front crop on T31 (fixed below). The picture check found the T20 day/night regression, a T10 black frame in the dark and the T41 channel-1 problem (known issues).
- **Encoder ROI:**
  - **T31** gets an ROI that the vendor library does not have (`IMP_Encoder_Set/GetChnRoiAttr` through the AVPU QP table, H.264, `OPENIMP_T31_ROI=0` refuses it): device-tested, relative -10 gave 2.7x the bit rate, 0 decoder errors in 20 VA-API checks.
  - **T10/T20/T21** apply `SetChnROI` and the chroma QP offset on the Helix/NVPU (T21 by default, beyond vendor, `OPENIMP_T21_ROI=0` switches it off): device-tested.
  - **Valid H.264 on every path:** window deltas -25..+25, spread at most 25, picture QP plus delta inside 0..51 and the rate control's min/max QP; a relative -26 used to give `mb_qp_delta` +26 at the window edge, which Intel VA-API, VLC, Firefox and Edge show as broken blocks (software ffmpeg hides it). Requests beyond that are clamped with a one-time warning.
  - **T23:** regions go to the vendor encoder, no visible effect (no-op). **T41:** code only, off unless `OPENIMP_T41_ROI=1`.
- **Front crop (open-tx-isp, device-tested):**
  - **T31:** a window smaller than a channel's scaler output stalled every MSCA output until reboot; the kernel now refuses it (-EINVAL), drops a crop that a larger main stream cannot fit, and writes the scaler steps so a valid window zooms. The picture effect on T31 is experimental, not proven.
  - **T23:** crop off unlocks the window, a window that does not fit is dropped instead of hanging, the lock is released with the ISP session (the 2026-10-06 crop hang is fixed).
  - **T20/T10:** a window is kept while no downscaled channel is open and applied at stream on, and released with the tuning session.
  - **T31/T23:** module parameter `fcrop_upscale_pct` (default 0) lets the geometry check tolerate a measured upscale (T23: up to 2.0).
- **T20 day/night:** `isp-m0` reported an analog gain cap of 158 while the AE stops at 128, so the streamer never saw the cap reached; it now reports the smaller value (host-tested; the streamer needs its matching change, timps 5bc4eff).
- **DeepSeek patches:** vendor ABI struct sizes (T40/T41), encoder group bounds (6; 8 kept on T23/T40), T31 IVS channel 64, `OSD_SetPoolSize(0)` rejected, idempotent T31 IVS group create/destroy, `PollingStream` guards, `GetDefaultBinPath`. Host-tested and cross-built; device checks pending.
- Details: [docs/OPEN_STACK_CHANGELOG.md](docs/OPEN_STACK_CHANGELOG.md), section "2026-10-07 to 2026-10-09: agg-32 soak and release candidate agg-34"; per-function state: [docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md](docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md); ROI rules: [docs/ROI.md](docs/ROI.md); beyond-vendor items: [docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md](docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md).

### Known issues (agg-34)

- **T41 sub-channel (channel 1):** green or flat frames at each day/night switch and the exposure of channel 1 does not follow channel 0; T41 is not part of the first release.
- **T20 day/night** needs the driver fix (da9baf1e) and the streamer change (timps 5bc4eff); with agg-32 alone both T20 cameras stayed in Day mode in the dark.
- **T31 front crop:** the crash is fixed, the picture effect is not proven.
- **T10:** occasional switch to Day in the dark with a black frame (3 events in 44 h).
- The older candidate's known issues below apply unless stated here; the T23 crop hang is fixed.

## Summary by area (state of 2026-10-06 evening)

All test cameras run the open stack (open-tx-isp kernel driver + OpenIMP + timps) from full OTA images built from thingino `aperto`; no Ingenic or neo helper libraries remain, and T23 runs without helixd and without vendor libimp.

### Release candidate (OpenIMP `agg-27`, open-tx-isp `agg-28`)

| SoC | In the first release | apitest of 2026-10-06 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| T10 | yes, **not re-tested** | not run | userspace is the T20 build, cells mirror T20 |
| T20 | yes | 212 PASS / 0 FAIL on two cameras | `GetAeZone` is a vendor no-op (N/A); encoder ROI and chroma QP offset |
| T21 | yes | 228 PASS / 0 FAIL on two cameras | `SetBrightness` acts and sepia works (beyond vendor); antifog/scene are vendor no-ops |
| T23 | yes | 304 PASS / 4 FAIL (AF getters, fixed by `source_af=1`) | stock-like release defaults, MSCA scratch buffer; H.265 has no hardware; **crop hang open** |
| T31 | yes | 274 PASS / 1 FAIL | `SetFrameDrop` with stock semantics; H.264 stall after JPEG teardown fixed (agg-29) |
| T41 | **no** (experimental) | 255 PASS / 12 FAIL on the experimental branch | channel 1 scaling registers staged, output-restart hang, 38 tuning IDs missing |

- **Frame source and encoder (all SoCs):** `GetFrame`/`SnapFrame` wait up to 2 s like the vendor library and the T20 capture no longer stalls (apps that set a frame depth got no frames before); `Encoder_GetFd` returns a pollable pipe; a JPEG channel feeds itself from the frame source when its video channel is not polled (beyond vendor); two IVS groups as every vendor libimp; `InsertUserData` SEI; `PollingModuleStream` honours the channel bitmap.
- **T20/T10/T21:** encoder ROI and H.264 chroma QP offset on the Helix/NVPU (T20 device-tested; T21 stores ROI/QPG/SuperFrame like the vendor and applies them after the release).
- **T21:** `SetBrightness` acts through the AE target and SEPIA works (both beyond vendor); `SetDPStrength`/`SetAntiFogAttr` exported like the vendor.
- **T23:** pool rmem parked as on T21, driver defaults are the stock-like set that ran 7 h overnight, STREAMOFF drain wait and QBUF cache invalidate (no cold-start snapshot 503), MSCA scratch buffer for stopped channels (beyond stock), AF statistics on by default, 19 ISP getters routed, `GetSensorRegister` offset fixed.
- **T31:** stack overruns of `GetAwbZone`/`GetAWBCt` fixed (a bus error in apitest), `SetFrameDrop` with the stock lsize/fmark semantics, `EnableDefog` takes its flag, vendor Movestate logic (host-tested).
- Vendor no-ops are matched, not "fixed": T21 antifog/scene, T20/T10 `GetAeZone`, T23 `GetBlcAttr`. T23 H.265 stays refused (no hardware).
- Details: [docs/OPEN_STACK_CHANGELOG.md](docs/OPEN_STACK_CHANGELOG.md), section "2026-10-06 afternoon/evening: release candidate agg-27/agg-28"; per-function state: [docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md](docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md); beyond-vendor items: [docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md](docs/OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md).

### OpenIMP (userspace libimp)

- **Against the vendor library**
  - Functions that were stubs or silent no-ops in the vendor stack now act: T21 controls and noise reduction, T10 noise-reduction strength, `ae_it_max_us` on T21, T23 brightness/contrast/saturation/hue, getters that return what was set.
  - Smaller: libimp about 0.5-0.6 MB instead of 1.0-1.3 MB (`gc-sections`, tables generated instead of copied); more free video memory on T21 (2.76 MB instead of about 1.2 MB); reference-frame sharing on T21/T23 (about 1.5 MB less video memory, on by default).
  - More robust: checked inputs, rate-limited error logs, bounded waits, clean stop/reload (0 oops in 10 cycles per SoC); clear errors instead of silent `-1`/0 (for example H.265 on SoCs without HEVC fails at once so streamers fall back to H.264).
  - Beyond the vendor API (documented for streamer authors in OPENIMP_BEYOND_VENDOR.md): motion detection v2 with bounding boxes and strength (`OPENIMP_MOTION_V2=0` restores the vendor algorithm), rmem high-water logging and shortfall hints, effective rate control logged per channel.
- **Against the original opensensor/openimp line**
  - Encoders: real HEVC and hardware JPEG on T31; native Helix H.264 on T23 (no vendor helper); hardware JPEG on T20/T21/T23 without the vendor library; H.265 on T41 (AVPU).
  - Rate control: vendor Allegro core on T31, OEM controllers on T10/T20 (default), eprc on T21/T23 (0 oracle deviations), capped modes mapped properly instead of silent CBR.
  - Image and audio: OSD (text, bitmap, rectangle, line) on T20/T21/T30, real frame-diff motion detection on T20/T21/T30, software rotation on T31, real AECM echo cancellation on T31 (-18 dB echo), volume/mute and whole-fragment audio writes.
  - SoC coverage: T41 stream buffers, flip, BCSH and unload fixes; T30 builds against a real kernel (no device in the campaign).
  - Hardening from audits and an independent review: NULL crashes, buffer overflows (T31 AF/AE getters, module-chain dump, OSD size, ABI struct sizes), EINTR and `O_CLOEXEC` handling, T23 reconfigure race.

### open-tx-isp (kernel driver)

- **Against the vendor driver**: lifecycle hardening on all SoCs (locking, use-after-free, STREAMOFF races, last-close races, bounded tuning access, checked user copies); module reload clean on every SoC including T41; modules smaller than the vendor ones on T21 (452 vs 616 KB), T23 (622 vs 857 KB) and T31 (711 vs 829 KB); sensor module pinned while the ISP is open; sensor registry under `/proc/jz/sensor`; optional 8 MB MMAP pool on T10/T20; unknown control IDs are rejected instead of silently succeeding.
- **Against the original line**: exposure readback and vendor-format `isp-m0` on all T-series; T21 stock AE, ADR and control dispatchers lifted instruction by instruction (night flicker gone); T23 about 45 control IDs wired and the vendor AE lifted (default on); T20 simple AE/AWB with limits; T31 AF/AE statistics, SensorAttr and WaitFrame through the driver; T41 gc5603 tuning fix and the channel-restart hang fix.

### timps and thingino

- timps changes are made by the timps maintainers; OpenIMP only provides what the streamer calls (for example AE IT max reset to 0).
- thingino: packages `openimp` and `open-tx-isp` are in upstream branch `aperto` ([#1756](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1756)), pinned to the Lu-Fi forks; kernel VPU/rmem stability patches (#1748, #1752), optional boot guard (#1749) and SC2336 flip fixes (#1750, #1751) are merged there.

### Known issues (release candidate)

- **T23 crop hang:** the pipeline stops after a FrameSource crop change; under investigation, release blocker.
- **T31 H.264 stalls after the JPEG channel is torn down:** fixed: two threads polled the same encoder channel at once (`AL_Codec_Encode_Process` concurrently); `IMP_Encoder_PollingStream` now serialises per channel (openimp `claude/release-fix27` 5c2ccef), apitest on T31 FAIL 0 with the fix; goes into the next candidate (agg-29).
- **T41 is not part of the first release:** channel 1 scaling registers are staged, an output restart hangs the SoC, 38 tuning IDs are missing (branches `claude/release-t41` and open-tx-isp `claude/t41-ch1-fix`, not merged).
- T21: the OSD blend takes effect only about 2 s after a wake from idle (the first snapshot waits for it); cause not found.
- The colour image functions must be re-tested in daylight (the candidate's imgfx run was made in the dark); T10 was not re-tested.

### Known open items (older)

T23 sporadic single Helix encode error (errno 5; the frequent frame drops are fixed) and T23 real WDR; T41 flip, night column noise, short IVS gaps, day/night and AE/AWB quality; T21 a 4th module reload in one boot crashed once; AEC device tests on T23/T21/T20 (no speaker tests on shared cameras); first release tag after the 24 h soak. Details: the "Still open" section of the full log and the feature matrix.

## OpenIMP changes by date (condensed)

Only OpenIMP (userspace libimp) changes, newest first. Everything listed was device-tested on the SoC named unless marked otherwise.

## 2026-10-09

- Release candidate `agg-34` (838f8147): agg-32 plus the ROI clamp and the reviewed DeepSeek patches (see the section above).
- ROI: every window delta is limited to -25..+25 (spread at most 25, picture QP plus delta inside the rate control's min/max QP) on T31 and on the T10/T20/T21 Helix command lists, so hardware decoders no longer show broken blocks; under FixQP the T31 table is not clamped to the RC range. T31 measured: relative -20 became -19, 0 decoder errors in 20 VA-API checks.
- DeepSeek review: vendor ABI layouts, encoder group bounds (6; 8 on T23/T40), T31 IVS channel 64, `OSD_SetPoolSize(0)`, idempotent T31 IVS group create/destroy, `PollingStream` guards (host-tested; device checks pending).
- open-tx-isp (not OpenIMP): front-crop guards on T31/T23/T20/T10 and the T20 `isp-m0` gain cap, see the section above.

## 2026-10-07 to 2026-10-08 (agg-30 to agg-32)

- T10/T20/T21: encoder ROI and chroma QP offset on the Helix/NVPU; T21 `SetChnROI` effective by default (beyond vendor, `OPENIMP_T21_ROI=0` switches it off); `roitest` tool.
- T31: encoder ROI through the AVPU QP table (`IMP_Encoder_Set/GetChnRoiAttr`, beyond vendor, `OPENIMP_T31_ROI=0` refuses it); T41: experimental ROI table, off by default (`OPENIMP_T41_ROI=1`).
- Soak of agg-32 for 43.4 h on ten cameras (see the section above).

## 2026-10-06

- Release candidate `agg-27` (merge of the release branches); the apitest/imgfx FAILs of the day were fixed or classified (T20 212 PASS / 0 FAIL, T21 228 / 0, T23 304 / 4 with the AF getters fixed afterwards, T31 274 / 1). See the summary above and the full log.
- FrameSource T20 (`claude/t20-fs-frames`): `REQBUFS` count = pool size (+ max delay) and `SET_BANKS` as the vendor library; before, apps that set a frame depth got `nrVBs` frames and then nothing. `SetFrameDepth(chn, 0)` succeeds.
- FrameSource T20/T21/T23/T31: `GetFrame`/`SnapFrame` wait up to 2 s like the vendor library; the T20 capture thread no longer sleeps in `DQBUF` without a queued buffer (`claude/release-fs-enc-ivs`, `claude/release-quickwins`).
- Encoder: `IMP_Encoder_GetFd` (pipe plus pump thread); a JPEG channel reads the frame source itself when its video channel is not polled; `InsertUserData` emits a `user_data_unregistered` SEI on T20/T21/T23; `PollingModuleStream` honours the input bitmap; T31 `SetMaxStreamCnt` refused on a created channel.
- IVS: two groups as every vendor libimp (group 1 move/base-move device-tested on T20/T21).
- T31: `GetAwbZone` passed a stack struct of pointers where the driver copies 675 bytes (bus error); `GetAWBCt` always returned -1; `EnableDefog` always wrote 1 (`claude/release-t23-getters`, `claude/release-deepseek-defog`).
- T23: `GetSensorRegister` bus-type offset, `FrameSource_GetPool`, monotonic audio frame stamps (`claude/release-t23-getters`); the pool rmem is parked at `DisableChn` as on T21 (`claude/release-t23-vbm`, 40 streamer restarts, every snapshot OK, 0 oopses; `OPENIMP_VBM_PARK=0` frees at once).
- T21: `SetDPStrength` and `SetAntiFogAttr` exported like the vendor T21 libimp (DP strength reaches the DPC ratio, antifog goes to control 0x8000163 which the OEM kernel accepts without effect) (`claude/release-t21-image`). `SetBrightness` acts through the AE target (beyond vendor, driver change in open-tx-isp `claude/release-t21-brightness`; imgfx Y 28.8/117.7/193.0 for 30/128/225, timps `image.brightness` live 44.5/130.8/223.9). SEPIA works (open-tx-isp `claude/release-t21-image`).
- Core: `IMP_Log_Set_Option` exported; `DisableSensor` passes -1 to `DESTROY_LINKS` like stock (patches from an automated review, verified against the vendor disassembly).
- Release quick wins (host-tested only): T21 `SetModuleControl` cache fallback, `AI_SetHpfCoFrequency(0)` accepted on T40/T41, P3 capture restart guard, T21 OSD INFO lines trace-only.
- Pending (host-tested and cross-built only): `IMP_AI_SetHpfCoFrequency` takes effect on T23/T31 (float biquad in libaudioProcess-neo, beyond the original library); T31 Enable/DisableMovestate run the vendor logic; T21 `QpgMode`/`H265TransCfg` as the vendor; `SetbufshareChn` documented as store-only.
- imgfx: the green/magenta stripe in the top rows of the saved ch1 pictures was a tool error (chroma plane read at the wrong offset); streams and snapshots were never affected.
- Known issues of the candidate: T23 crop hang (under investigation); T31 H.264 stall after JPEG teardown fixed for agg-29, T41 not part of the release.

## 2026-10-05

- T10/T20/T21: front crop and CSC presets (beyond vendor, device-tested: crop, rejection of invalid values, 10 cycles), software rotation 90/270 on sub streams (T21 with OSD, colours correct), CSC mode 4 sign fix (green picture on T10/T20), encoder ROI and chroma QP offset (T20 device-tested; QP51 region coarse, QP15 fine, absolute QP bypasses CBR).
- T20/T21/T23/T31/T41: many vendor functions connected that were stubs, cache-only or missing (audit of every vendor IMP/SU function per SoC, see the feature matrix): AE/AWB zone and statistics getters, WaitFrame, ModuleControl, delay FIFO (`SetMaxDelay`/`SetDelay`/`GetTimedFrame`), `FlushStream`, AENC/ADEC on all SoCs, `IMP_AO_CacheSwitch`, T41 `SnapFrame`.
- T31: stack overruns fixed and verified with guard arenas: `GetAfHist` wrote 88 bytes into the 24-byte vendor struct, `Get/SetAeAttr` overran the caller by 80 bytes; AF statistics chain rebuilt (focus value, zones, weights, histogram).
- T23: `SetGamma` takes effect at once (steep/linear curves visible, falling curve rejected, restore ok).
- T21: the first snapshot after a start or an idle wake had no OSD (the IPU blend has no effect for about 2 s after a wake); OpenIMP now verifies the blend on a glyph pixel and withholds JPEG frames without a confirmed overlay (beyond vendor: the vendor stack shows the same missing OSD).
- T41: restarting one channel while the other streams hung the SoC; a driver fix (flip update only on a real change, output kept like the vendor on stream-off) passed the targeted repro 35/35 and a 40 min soak; the hang returns once the MSCA output geometry is latched correctly (see the known issues above, T41 is not part of the first release).

## 2026-10-09 (branch `claude/roi-qp-clamp`, host-tested only)

- ROI QP stays valid H.264 (`src/avpu_roi.h`, `Helix_H264_RoiSanitize`): the encoder codes `mb_qp_delta` against the previous macroblock and H.264 allows -26..+25 only; outside it ffmpeg hides the error but VA-API/VLC/browsers show broken blocks (measured on T10/T20 with relative -26 and absolute 15 at QP 42). Every window delta is now in -25..25, the spread of all deltas (uncovered = 0) at most 25, picture QP + delta inside 0..51 and the RC min/max QP; larger requests are clamped with a one-time warning.
  - T31 (and the experimental T41 table): `SetChnRoiAttr` refuses a delta outside -26..25 like the vendor T41 (before: -32..31); the table follows the picture QP when the clamp depends on it.
  - T10/T20/T21: `IMP_Encoder_SetChnROI` clamps when each command list is built (relative -25..25, absolute inside max QP - 25 .. min QP + 25 of the picture, spread 25); a QP argument beyond the s8 range keeps its sign.
  - T20 (review of agg-34): an absolute QP the clamp would push to the far side of the slice QP (cap 51 at slice QP 20: absolute 15 became 26, worse than the surroundings) is left at the slice QP instead, i.e. the region becomes a no-op rather than inverting the request. Test case absolute 15 at slice QP 20, cap 51.
  - Test `tests/t31/roi_clamp_test.c` (20000 random window sets, each table walked like the encoder).

## 2026-10-07 (branch `claude/roi-all`, not part of the first release)

- T21: `IMP_Encoder_SetChnROI` is effective by default (beyond vendor: the stock T21 libimp stores the regions but never programs them). With no region set the command list is unchanged; `OPENIMP_T21_ROI=0` switches it off. Device-tested on the PC420 (jxf23, 1920x1080, FixQP 30, one 320x320 region): absolute QP 51 is a visible block, QP 15 stays clean, delta +/-15 works, live changes (P frames, no IDR) work. FixQP bitrate 657 kbit/s without ROI, 340 with QP 51, 504 with QP 15; CBR keeps the target (the bits move between the regions). Test tool `tools/roitest`.
- T41: `IMP_Encoder_SetChnRoiAttr/GetChnRoiAttr` (vendor T41 API, 10 windows, delta QP) exist but are experimental and off (`OPENIMP_T41_ROI=1`): the macroblock QP table in EP2 was identified from a vendor capture and is written, but the AVPU did not react on the test camera; default behaviour unchanged (see `docs/ROI.md`).
- T31: encoder ROI (beyond vendor, branch `claude/t31-roi`): `IMP_Encoder_SetChnRoiAttr/GetChnRoiAttr` with the T41 API, 10 windows, delta QP -32..31 or absolute 0..51, live without IDR. The vendor Allegro core shows the switch: cmd[9] bit 25 = use the EP2 macroblock QP table, bit 24 = relative; the table is one byte per macroblock after the 0x40-byte EP2 header. Device-tested on cam-A (sc4336p 2560x1440): FixQP 30 with a 768x512 window, delta +20 / absolute 51 blurs exactly the window (IDR 176 to 156 KB), absolute 10 sharpens it (247 KB), two windows at once, CBR keeps the target; 0 oops. `OPENIMP_T31_ROI=0` switches it off.
- T41 (code only): the same enable bits found in the vendor T41 1.2.6 (`SliceParamToCmdRegsEnc1`: cmd[152] bit 0 = use table, bit 3 = relative); OpenIMP set neither, which explains why the T41 table had no effect. Set now under `OPENIMP_T41_ROI=1`, not yet device-tested.

## 2026-10-06

- T31: `IMP_FrameSource_GetFrame`/`SnapFrame` wait up to 2 s like the vendor libimp (T31 1.1.6 header: default timeout 2 s) instead of failing at once (branch `claude/release-quickwins`, host-tested only). The T31 encoder pulls with `VBMGetFrame` and keeps its own deadline. T41 already waits (about 1 s of DQBUF retries, `openimp_p1.c`) and is unchanged.
- Release quick wins from the 2026-10-06 review (`claude/release-quickwins`, host-tested only): T21 `IMP_ISP_Tuning_SetModuleControl` falls back to the cache when the open T21 driver rejects control 0x80000e2 (T31 still fails); `IMP_AI_SetHpfCoFrequency(0)` is accepted on T40/T41 (0 = default, as on T31); the P3 capture start is refused while the previous capture thread has not exited (no free of the buffer it still uses); the T21 OSD retry/probe and JPEG fan-out INFO lines are trace-only (`openimp_debug_trace_enabled`).
- T23: the FrameSource pool's rmem is parked at DisableChn, as on T21 (branch `claude/release-t23-vbm`). The open T23 driver keeps a stopped MSCA output enabled while the input runs, so the pool is no longer handed to other allocations while the MSCA may still write into it. The block is freed by `DestroyChn`, or at once with `OPENIMP_VBM_PARK=0`.
  - Tested on the Jooan A6M (raptor) together with open-tx-isp `claude/release-t23-driver`: 40 streamer restarts with every snapshot OK, 0 oopses.
- T21: `IMP_ISP_Tuning_SetDPStrength` and `IMP_ISP_Tuning_SetAntiFogAttr` are exported like the vendor T21 libimp (an application built against the T21 SDK did not load without them). DP strength (vendor percentage, cap 200) reaches the open driver's DPC ratio; AntiFog goes to control 0x8000163 like the vendor, which the OEM kernel accepts without effect.
- imgfx: the green/magenta stripe in the top rows of the saved ch1 pictures was a tool error (chroma plane read at width*height instead of after ALIGN16(height) lines); JPEG snapshots and streams were never affected.
- Pending (branch `claude/streamer-gaps-t1x-t23-t31`, host-tested and cross-built only, no device test yet): `IMP_AI_SetHpfCoFrequency` takes effect on T23/T31 (and, untested, T41): `IMP_AI_EnableHpf` designs the filter for the cut-off like the vendor library (illegal for a negative value or above the sample rate; 0 = default tables) and hands it to libaudioProcess-neo as a float biquad at the stream's rate (beyond the original library, which takes libimp's coefficient pointer; neo is recognised by its DRC export); `IMP_AO_EnableHpf` reaches neo the same way. T31 `IMP_ISP_Tuning_Enable/DisableMovestate` run the vendor library's logic (AE block of control 0x800002c, day/night limits from `/etc/sensor/<sensor>move.txt` loaded by EnableTuning, IDR on channel 0 on disable; the stock T31 driver ignores the control). T21 `IMP_Encoder_Get/SetQpgMode` keep any value like the vendor library (nothing reads it there), `IMP_Encoder_Get/SetH265TransCfg` check and drop like the vendor (Get returns zeros). `IMP_Encoder_Get/SetJpegeQl` on T10/T20/T21 was already applied to the running encoder (host test added). `IMP_Encoder_SetbufshareChn` on T31 is store-only in the vendor library too.
- T21 `IMP_ISP_Tuning_SetBrightness` now acts (beyond vendor; the vendor T21 kernel only stores the value): needs open-tx-isp `claude/release-t21-brightness`, no libimp change. Device-tested on the PC420 (jxf23): brightness 30/128/225 gives Y 28.8/117.7/193.0, timps `image.brightness` live the same. 128 is the vendor picture.

## 2026-10-04

- thingino: `openimp` and `open-tx-isp` are part of upstream `aperto` ([#1756](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1756)), pinned to the Lu-Fi forks; the T23 OEM Helix helper option and hybrid install are gone. All test cameras run `aperto` images (30/30 snapshots, 0 oops, 0 VPU errors).
- T41: stream buffers sized like the vendor, rmem arena split so an idle 1080p stream can always restart, no software H.264 stub (it produced a corrupt stream); AE compensation, gain/exposure caps and noise reduction reach the ISP.
- Pending (on a branch, not yet in `next`): the audio capture read size that always covers whole driver fragments (ported from an upstream patch, author credited), after the 24 h soak.
- T20/T10: rmem high-water logging and shortfall messages with a concrete suggestion when reserved memory is too small instead of silent degradation.
- Hardening: repeated driver errors rate-limited, silent `-1` returns logged, four NULL crashes, a buffer overflow in the module-chain dump, lost items on EINTR and an OSD size overflow fixed.
- T31: `SetChnQpIPDelta` now updates the value `GetChnAttrRcMode` returns, as the vendor does.
- T23: OSD stride fix (clean date/time text on main and sub stream); sub-stream reference fix; the OEM Helix helper option and the hybrid install are removed, T23 runs fully open. The frequent Helix frame drops are fixed (residual interrupt 0x100, kernel patch merged upstream); still open: a rare single Helix encode error (errno 5).
- T21/T23: sub-stream (640x360) corruption from reference sharing on the small channel fixed.
- T41: H.265 on the AVPU path (like T31); a stuck AVPU job times out after 2 s and resets the core. CBR overshoot fix, unload/flip/BCSH fixes in `next`.
- Review fixes: complete `O_CLOEXEC`, eprc `FRAME_END` for dropped pictures, T31 Allegro RC lock, forced IDR after a YUV error, T20 MB-RC table bounds.
- Size and CPU: T20 MB-RC table 590 to 58 KiB, no per-frame malloc; libimp T31 -34 KB, T41 -20 KB, T21 -17.5 KiB text; JPEG Huffman parsing by table, OSD cache invalidation, T31 EBSP copy (timps CPU T31 8.7 to 7.9 %, T21 17.5 to 15.5 %).
- Motion detection v2 (on by default; `OPENIMP_MOTION_V2=0` restores the vendor algorithm, bit-identical): background model per grid cell, suppression after IR/exposure switches, blob grouping, bounding boxes and strength through the versioned `OpenIMP_IVS_MoveGetResultEx` API; false alarms down in overnight runs.
- T30 readiness without hardware: builds for a real T30 kernel; fixed an `IMPEncoderCHNAttr` ABI size bug (4-byte overrun).
- `next` branch created; it tracks the tested aggregate (fast-forward only).

## 2026-10-03

- T10/T20/T21/T23 H.265: `IMP_Encoder_CreateChn(PT_H265)` fails with -1 and one log line on SoCs without HEVC hardware, so streamers fall back to H.264 at once (the vendor returns 0 and creates an empty channel).
- Rate control, T31: vendor Allegro core ported (VBR, CappedVBR, CappedQuality, CBR), state-identical against traces; closed-loop VBR; no filler NAL in CBR (deviation).
- Rate control, T21/T23 (eprc): vendor controller ported with 0 oracle deviations, default on T21; FIXQP, scene-cut IDR, runtime RC/fps/GOP/HSkip, `SetChnHSkip`; opt-in macroblock-level RC (`OPENIMP_EPRC_MBRC=1`).
- Rate control, T20/T10: vendor controllers as default (T20 I-aware P budget, T10 super-frame fix: re-encodes 800 to 0, CPU 8.3 to 5.5 %).
- T41: bitrate setting had no effect (negative bucket level discarded) fixed; OpenIMP runs against the vendor T41 driver with video, JPEG, OSD and motion detection.
- T10: picture drifting diagonally fixed (reference border added twice); noise-reduction strength acts (the vendor does nothing).
- T20: snapshot debounce no longer polls the JPEG encoder (14.4/15.0 fps instead of 11.2/14.3 with 1 snapshot/s); 270-line sub stream rounded to 272 instead of a scaler hang; bottom-row chroma fix.
- T23: brightness/contrast/saturation/hue act; JPEG shares the H.264 bitstream area (-1.44 MB); sub-stream rotation 90/270 on the native encoder; `IMP_Encoder_YuvSetCrop`; daylight green cast fixed by keeping white balance across stream restarts.
- T21: reference-buffer sharing on by default (~1.4 MB less video memory; `OPENIMP_REF_SHARE=0` disables); user contrast sent instead of default.
- Helix: encoder re-created after 3 failed pictures, channel stops after 2 fruitless re-creates; JPEG bitstream buffer 1 MiB (-328 KiB on a T10).
- Vendor logging functions built into libimp; `libalog`/`libsysutils` no longer needed on images.
- Size: `gc-sections` (T23 libimp 774 to 726 KB, T20 694 to 594 KB).
- Encoder diagnostics: effective rate control logged per channel, out-of-range QP/fps clamped with a warning.

## 2026-10-02

- T31: hardware JPEG default; real HEVC on the AVPU; software rotation 90/270; lambda tables generated from a formula; real AECM echo cancellation (-18 dB echo on a speech loopback).
- Helix (T20/T21/T23): hardware JPEG without the vendor library (~95 % less CPU for snapshots); dedicated JPEG/MJPEG channel gets frames; OSD lines, rectangles and bitmaps drawn on T31/T20/T21/T30.
- T23: native Helix H.264 encoder is the default, no vendor helper or vendor libimp; RC parameters reach the encoder; bitstream overflow handling (frame dropped and QP raised instead of a stuck channel).
- T21: shared bitstream buffer sized like the vendor (main/sub switching works), EMC scratch sized like the vendor (free rmem 1.56 to 2.76 MB).
- Robustness audits: AEC reference queue heap overflow, audio-effect switch use-after-free, double stop, DQBUF/EPIPE races at channel stop.
- Independent review: T23 reconfigure divide-by-zero race fixed; top-level `NOTICE` added.

## 2026-09-30 to 2026-10-01 (campaign start)

- ISP tuning: vendor defaults for contrast/sharpness; SDK control IDs and pointer semantics on T20/T21; T23 `GetSensorAttr` buffer overrun; T31 AF IDs and driver-backed SensorAttr/WaitFrame/ModuleControl.
- Day/night on T20/T21 re-sends image controls like the vendor.
- Encoder: CappedVBR/CappedQuality/SMART mapped to VBR with a log line instead of silent CBR; JPEG quality applied; channel-stat struct layout fixed.
- Motion detection: real frame-diff IVS on T20/T21/T30 (was always "no motion").
- Audio out: volume/mute applied, whole-fragment writes.
- T20/T21 framesource: pool parking and reuse instead of freeing on idle teardown.
- Tools: `t23tune` for T23 tuning on device.
