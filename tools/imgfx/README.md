# imgfx - one picture per image-changing IMP function (OpenIMP libimp)

Device test for T10, T20, T21, T23, T31, T41. It sets one function at a time,
waits (300 ms + 3 frames, longer for AE/AWB cases), saves the 640x360 channel-1
frame as raw NV12, prints one result line and restores the value it read
before, so cases are independent. No encoder is used (raw frames from
`IMP_FrameSource_GetFrame`), so the per-SoC encoder API differences do not matter.

    imgfx SENSOR I2C_ADDR W H OUTDIR [case-filter]
    imgfx --list                     # case names of this build

* FS ch0 = sensor size W x H, FS ch1 = 640x360 scaled; ch1 is what is saved.
* `case-filter` = substring of the case name (`awb`, `csc`, `fcrop`, ...).
  `NN` in the file name is the stable table index, filtered runs add to
  `OUTDIR/summary-<SoC>.txt` (append).
* Output per case: `OUTDIR/<NN>-<case>.nv12` and a line
  `[R] <case> set=<ret> get=<readback>` or `[R] <case> N/A`
  (function not exported by that libimp). `base` is taken first, `base-end`
  last (noise/drift reference for the collage).
* Env: `IMGFX_MODE=night` (IR-cut open / IR on: runs the whole test in night
  mode and restores to it), `IMGFX_SETTLE_MS=n` extra settle per case,
  `IMGFX_SKIP_RISKY=1` skips ISP bypass and FPS cases (they run last).
* Stop the streamer first (timps/prudynt: `/etc/init.d/S95timps stop`), keep
  the scene static and lit. Pictures are ~337 KB each, 70-100 per run: use a
  directory with 40+ MB free (camera `/tmp` is RAM; with little free RAM use
  filters in batches or an SD/NFS path).
* The saved file is packed NV12 (luma, then chroma). The ISP/VBM frame keeps the
  chroma plane after ALIGN16(height) luma lines (640x360: 368), so the tool
  reads it there (`uv_offset`); reading it at width*height shows the padding as
  a constant stripe in the top chroma rows and shifts the chroma by 16 lines.
* Case results are meant to be read with the host script (below); `set=0` only
  means the call returned 0. Calls the vendor kernel itself leaves without effect
  (T21 brightness, scene mode, AntiFog) carry `[stock-noop ...]` in the readback
  and are reported as "no change expected" instead of SUSPECT; `csc-0` on the
  OpenIMP-extension SoCs is `expected-same` (the default is preset 0).

## Cases (what the vendor API of that SoC offers)

base, base-end; ISP flip h/v/hv (+ SetHVFLIP enum on T23/T31, SetISPHVflip on
T10/T20, sensor flip on T23/T41); front crop mid50/topleft50 (T10/T20/T21 use
the OpenIMP crop extension, T23/T31 vendor `SetFrontCrop`), FS ch1 scaler crop
(`fs1-crop-*`: T21/T23 scale ch1 2x first, then crop the output size; on T23 a ch1 scaler locked by an earlier session makes the driver refuse it with -EINVAL), ePTZ AutoZoom ch1 (T23/T31/T41); brightness, contrast,
saturation, sharpness low/high, hue and `bcsh-combo` (T23/T31/T41); gamma
steep/linear; AE compensation low/high (T10/T20/T23/T31; T41 via
`AeScenceAttr` incl. HLC/BLC); manual exposure short/long (`SetExpr`, T41
`AeExprInfo`), `aeattr-*` manual AE/gain (T23/T31); max again/dgain limits;
AWB auto / manual R high / manual B high / presets (daylight, cloudy,
incandescent, fluorescent, twilight, shade, warm fluorescent), `awbct-*` and
`wbalgo-*` (T23/T31); CCM swap-rb/mono (T23/T31/T41); CSC modes 0..4 (T23/T31
vendor, T10/T20/T21 OpenIMP extension, T41 `ISPCSCAttr`); WDR/DRC
(T10/T20 `SetWDRAttr`+`SetRawDRC`, T21 `SetRawDRC`+`SetDRC_Strength`, T23/T31
`EnableDRC`+`SetDRC_Strength`, T41 module ratio); defog (T23/T31 enable +
strength, T10/T20/T21 `SetAntiFogAttr`, T41 ratio); sinter 2D NR and temper 3D
NR 0/255; dpc 0/255; hilight depress and backlight comp; privacy mask
(T23/T31 `SetMask`, T41 `SetMaskBlock`); scaler level; module bypass bits
(`bypass-*`, T21/T23/T31/T41); colorfx and scene mode (T10/T20/T21); mesh
shading scale (T10/T20); anti-flicker off/50/60; running mode day/night; ISP
bypass and FPS 15/10 (risky, last, picture only, rate not measured).

Restore notes: where the vendor API has no getter the default is assumed
(printed in `get=`): sinter/temper/dpc 128 (OpenIMP getters are used when
exported), antifog off, mesh shading M, defog/DRC enable via enable calls,
sensor flip 0.

(sc1a4t addr 0x30 and gc5603 0x31 / 2880x1620 are from the sensor drivers in
ingenic-sdk; the other values as given.)

Typical run:

    scp imgfx_t31 root@192.168.10.21:/tmp/
    ssh root@192.168.10.21
      /etc/init.d/S95timps stop
      mkdir -p /tmp/imgfx && cd /tmp && ./imgfx_t31 sc4336p 0x30 2560 1440 /tmp/imgfx | tee /tmp/imgfx/console.txt
      # night: IMGFX_MODE=night ./imgfx_t31 ...
    scp -r root@192.168.10.21:/tmp/imgfx ./cam-t31
    python3 imgfx_collage.py ./cam-t31          # jpg/, contact-N.jpg, report.txt

Reboot or restart the streamer afterwards (`/etc/init.d/S95timps start`).

## Host script

`imgfx_collage.py OUTDIR...` (python3 + PIL): converts every NV12 to JPEG,
writes labelled contact sheets (case + set ret + diff vs base) and
`report.txt` with mean abs diff vs base per channel (Y/U/V). Flags:
`SUSPECT-unconnected` = set returned 0 but the picture did not change,
`RET<0`, `N/A`. Threshold = max(1.0, 2.5 x noise) from base vs base-end.
Cases where no visible change is expected (anti-flicker, fps, awb-auto,
hilight depress, ...) are not flagged as suspect.

The set ret comes from the `[R]` lines of `summary-<SoC>.txt` and `*.log` in
OUTDIR; a filtered re-run appends only its own cases there, so keep the
console output of the full run (`tee console.txt`, rename to `.log`) or pass it
with `--log console.txt`. Cases without an `[R]` line show ret `?` (and can
still be flagged SUSPECT). The `dH%` column is the change of the mean
|Laplacian| of Y (detail + noise energy): sharpness, noise reduction and
shading change that, not the mean colour/brightness, so such cases get the
verdict `detail` instead of `same`.

Notes per function (T21, see docs/ of the driver): SetBrightness is the AE
target compensation (needs AE settle time); FS SetChnAttr (crop) only takes
effect with DisableChn/EnableChn and the T21 crop window is inside the scaler
output frame; RawDRC, SceneMode and Colorfx SEPIA are accepted-and-ignored by
the stock kernel; the T21 module bypass bits are the vendor T21 layout
(DPC 0, LSC 2, ADR 4, CCM 6, GAMMA 7, DEFOG 8, YSHARPEN 10, MDNS 11, SDNS 12),
checked at run time.

## Build

`./build.sh` cross-builds all six binaries (toolchain and libimp from
`/mnt/NVMe/git/thingino-out/<cam>/`, vendor headers from
`thingino-raptor-hal/ingenic-headers/<SoC>`). Every vendor function is declared
weak, one source builds everywhere; a function missing in the camera's libimp
prints `N/A` at run time.

## T41

The T41 pipeline init follows the vendor T41 flow (`IMP_ISP_AddSensor(num,
info)`, `EnableSensor(num, info)`, sensor_id/vi/mclk left 0 like timps) and the
new tuning API (`num` + pointer arguments). It builds and links, but the init
has not been run on a T41 here: first run may need a sensor-info fix.
